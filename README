Repository for tambeta.github.io. Powered by Jekyll. The helper script
requires Docker.

To build a new site:

$ ./build new _source

To serve and watch / build the site:

$ ./build serve -s _source -d _site

Access the site on http://localhost:4000.

The helper script (`build`) expects results to be generated into `_site`. This
is a transient directory not under version control. `build` also watches the
directory for changes and automatically rsyncs it to the root directory. This
dance is necessary as jekyll doesn't allow building into a destination
directory containing source, but GitHub Pages doesn't allow serving from
elsewhere than the root directory.
